# Titanic

My work is in TitanicLogisticRegression and in 
XGBoost-Classifier-on-Titanic-Data.

In TitanicLogisticRegression, I built a logistic regression 
model to predict survival on the Titanic. 

In XGBoost-Classifer-on-Titanic-Data, I used XBGClassifer
to predict survivors of the Titanic. 

The notebook titled 'Titanic study on various modeling' is 
downloaded from Kaggle for my learning purposes.
